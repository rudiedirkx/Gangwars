<td>You cant immediatly play after your signup. You'll have to be invited to enter a Gang. You can also start a new gang yourself; in that case, you are the gangleader!

<td><b>General info:<br>This game is fast; faster than any; very fast. Every tick (mostlikely to be 30sec.) one turn will be added and interest will be calculated (Businessmen only). This speed can be in your advantage, if you play long and much (why not spend 60hours of your weekend?). It <u>will</u> be your disadvantage when you dont play for a day; you could be murdered, you could be robbed and be in a hospital (which will have to be paid).</td>
